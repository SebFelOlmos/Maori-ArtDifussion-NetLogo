# Modeling the Diffusion of Artistic Traditions among Maori Communities

This simulation model, influenced by Roger Neich's work "Painted Histories: Early MƒÅori Figurative Painting" (1993) and drawing on aspects of Gell's art theory, explores the diffusion of art traditions within Maori communities. It served as the final project for the "Introduction to Complexity" class within the Master's program in Modelagem de Sistemas Complexos.

## Key Considerations
In drawing conclusions from this model, it becomes evident that a more comprehensive understanding of the social rules governing art diffusion is essential. The model's structure and the simplicity of rules employed partially explain the intricate patterns observed by Neich. It is crucial to recognize the significance of the social context and acknowledge that the model's parameters may not fully encapsulate the complexities of art diffusion among Maori communities.

Additionally, a critical reflection on the quality of the data sourced from Neich's work is essential. While Neich's text is commendable, its primary focus may not align perfectly with the specific question our model seeks to address. Consequently, the data used for parameterization may not be optimal, prompting the need for caution in interpreting the results.

## Future Directions
Acknowledging the limitations identified in this model, there is a clear need for further research. Future endeavors could focus on acquiring more nuanced social data to enhance the accuracy of the model. Identifying and incorporating additional factors that contribute to the diffusion of artistic traditions among Maori communities would provide a more comprehensive understanding.

## Conclusion
In summary, while this model contributes valuable insights, it underscores the complexity of the social dynamics governing the diffusion of art traditions. Addressing the need for richer social data and refining the model to capture additional variables are crucial steps toward a more nuanced understanding of this intricate phenomenon.
